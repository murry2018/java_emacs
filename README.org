* emacs configuration
I found the original repository from [[https://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2020/11/04/java-programming-in-emacs][xpressrazor's article]]. This article gives you a nice tutorial for programming java in emacs. If you're interested in both java and emacs, I recommend you to read it.

** Original README by [[https://github.com/neppramod/java_emacs][neppramod]]
Tutorial and Configuration to setup java development for emacs. Read [[emacs-configuration.org]] for most of the setup. File [[init.el]] loads [[emacs-configuration.org]]

** Quickstart

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/murry2018/java_emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

** Trouble Shooting
*** Failed to download 'gnu' archive
If your system doesn't have gnutls library, install it first. In my case on ubuntu 20.04:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install gnutls-bin libgnutls28-dev
#+end_src

On emacs 26.x there is a TLS bug. If you are using these version it'd be better using more recent version, such as 27.x.
